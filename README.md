# FractalSeed

Offline Android utility that turns any wallet address into a unique, high-resolution fractal image in <30 s.  
One-bit change in the address → completely different picture, making manual verification fun and obvious.

## Build
1. Install Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer.  
2. Open the repo root → wait for Gradle sync.  
3. Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK → release.

## Usage
Type or paste any 0x… address → tap **Generate** → image auto-saves to Pictures/FractalSeed.

## Next ideas
- Compare two images side-by-side.  
- Export vector (SVG) for sharp prints.  
- Chrome/Edge extension using same Rust/WASM fractal core.
